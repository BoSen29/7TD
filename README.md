# Narrow Master Minded
![NarrowMasterMinded Release](https://github.com/LegionTD2-Modding/NarrowMasterMinded/actions/workflows/build_release_tag.yml/badge.svg)

This Legion TD2 mod was originally made for [Pennywise](https://www.twitch.tv/pennywiseuk), to only allow the mastermind legion Yolo (aka _the only good option_)\
But it was extended to make the option configurable directly in game with a new options tab.

Additionally, this mod will serve as demo/tutorial for the LTD2 modding framework once it is available.\
It is therefore copiously commented to help anyone wanting to understand its inner workings.

## Installation
- Close the game
- If not already done, follow this guide to install [BepInEx](https://github.com/LegionTD2-Modding/.github/wiki/Installation-of-BepInEx)
